# Detection-of-Parkinson-s-Disease

What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. 
What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees.

Goal: In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we will build a model using an XGBClassifier.

What does a Min-Max scaler do?
A MinMaxScaler scales the features to between -1 and 1 to normalize them. It transforms features by scaling them to a given range.

About the model:
Initialize an XGBClassifier and train the model. This classifies using eXtreme Gradient Boosting- using gradient boosting algorithms for modern data science problems. 
It falls under the category of Ensemble Learning in ML, where we train and predict using many models to produce one superior output.
Logistic Regression as well as Support Vector Machine has also been used but they both give a lower accuracy than XGBoost classifier.
